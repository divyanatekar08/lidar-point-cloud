# lidar-point-cloud
Hello, I am Divya Natekar, a graduate student at New York University, pursuing an MS in Applied Urban Science & Informatics at the Center for Urban Science + Progress (CUSP), at Tandon School of Engineering.

This GitHub repository is focused on showcasing the programs and other associated workings that I have developed as a part of my Summer 2025 research project, under the guidance of Professor Debra Laefer. My project was focused on LiDAR data processing and transient object removal, thus simulating a realistic terrestrial laser scanning system, in order to improve visibility and occlusion-based filtering in dense urban environments.

Technologies & Tools used:
<br>Languages: Python, C
<br>Libraries: Open3D, NumPy, Matplotlib
<br>Tools: CloudCompare, SketchFab, Jupyter Notebook
